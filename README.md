## Maximize Your Productivity

## Procrastination is the Enemy of Productivity

We procrastinate for various reasons:
It can be due to our own pressure for making the perfect project.
It can also be due to fear of making mistakes or receiving negative feedback.
All we need is a starting point to push us through the initial hurdles. Our Focus App does just that. It motivates the user into finishing the task at hand.

## Features of the App:

Has focus timer which lets the user focus on the task at hand. Users can customize the length of a session.  Each session is classified as a round. A round is cleared once the timer hits 0:00. 
Users can also customize the break time between sessions.
Stores statistics and progress of the user. Provides a graph that plots round cleared on a particular day. This motivates the user to maintain a consistent schedule.

## Advantages of using this App:

Helps in dealing with Information Absorbing. Cramming too much information is detrimental and is an inefficient use of time. Absorbing information for a specific amount of time will lead to better memorization.
Helps in dealing with hyperactivity. Exerting oneself for a long time will cause fatigue and eventually burnout. Taking breaks in between spirited sessions will lead to efficient use of time and significantly higher productivity.
